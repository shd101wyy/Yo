# yo-self: root-cause map for all 26 HOLLOW test files (2026-07-29)

Measured with a **swallow-diagnostic s1** — a build carrying `eprintln` probes at the three
definition-time swallow sites — swept over every hollow file, then **noise-subtracted against
GREEN files**. Tooling: `scratchpad/swallow_sweep.sh` (+ `scratchpad/capture_markers.sh` for the
REDs). This replaces guesswork: a hollow file's single `Failed to transpile` marker IS the whole
batch dispatch expression, so the marker text says nothing about which arm failed — the swallowed
error does.

## Why this measurement was needed

Batch dispatch is all-or-nothing: any one arm whose definition-time evaluation throws empties the
whole `__yo_user_main`, so every test in the file "passes" vacuously. One bad arm hollows a file
with 100 good tests. The swallowed error names that arm's actual failure.

Probe sites (the three swallows):

| Probe     | Site                                                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__DBG_W` | `yo-self/evaluator/exprs/_expr.yo` catch-all (`note_def_time_swallow`)       |
| `__DBG_F` | `yo-self/evaluator/calls/function_type.yo` `_trial_eval_fn_body` `inner_exn` |
| `__DBG_A` | `yo-self/evaluator/values/anonymous_function.yo` `inner_exn` (two sites)     |

## NOISE — confirmed present in GREEN files, must be subtracted

Do **not** chase these. Baseline taken on `arc`, `imm_string`, `iso`, `iso_api_surface`,
`module_struct_unification` (all GREEN):

| Swallowed message                                                            | Seen in GREEN         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `__DBG_A Expected expression value for "__yo_expr_to_string" argument`       | **all 5** — universal |
| `__DBG_F Incompatible types:`                                                | `imm_string` (×2)     |
| `__DBG_F Failed to evaluate right-hand side of assignment: (reversed._head)` | `imm_string`          |
| `__DBG_W use of moved value: \`x\``                                          | `iso`                 |

Two consequences:

- A bare `Incompatible types:` is **not** evidence of a defect on its own — it needs the full
  message body and a per-file check.
- `imm_map` / `imm_set` import `imm_string`, so their `Incompatible types:` and `reversed._head`
  swallows are inherited noise, not their own failure.

Also benign: `__DBG_F` fires for expected errors during a `comptime_expect_error` argument
evaluation (propagate mode). A **quoted** message (e.g. `"Cannot use \`a\` from outer scope"`) is
usually the error a `cee`*wanted*. The unambiguous defect signal in that family is instead`Expected compile error, but the expression was evaluated successfully`—`cee` saw no error.

## Real root causes, grouped by multiplicity

### Shared roots (one fix, several files) — best value

| Root                                                                                                                                                               | Files                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Expected a label for function parameter, got requires(y != i32(0))` — yo-self does not accept contract clauses in a function parameter list                       | `spec/contracts_phase0`, `spec/pragma_no_contracts`, `spec/pragma_verify` (**3**) |
| `Type mismatch for type member "_f":`                                                                                                                              | `iterator_combinators`, `where_clause_fn_inference` (**2**)                       |
| `Expected compile error, but the expression was evaluated successfully` — a validation TS performs and yo-self does not (one distinct missing validation per file) | `basic`, `closure`, `fn` (×2), `inherent_first_resolution` (**4**)                |

### Unported features (each an explicit yo-self stub)

| File                  | Swallowed error                                                          |

| `iter_filter_closure` | `evaluate_function_call: TypeVal SomeT callee without FnTrait (Phase 4)` |
| `type_reflection`     | `__yo_type_get_info: unsupported type variant`                           |

### Needs the full message body before it can be classified

`async_await`, `gadts`, `string/string`, `sys/file` (`Incompatible types:`) and `env`, `prelude`
(`Cannot unify incompatible types:`) — the truncated head matches known noise. Re-read the full
multi-line message out of `/tmp/swal/<mangled>.log` before treating any of these as a defect.

## UPDATE 2026-07-29 (later) — measured after five fixes landed

Re-measured with a FRESH probe build (`/tmp/s1_swal3`, built from the tree at
commit `2b70886da`). Landed since the table above: the `___dispose` deep-SomeT
filter, the `comptime_str`->`*(u8)` coercion, `open()` declared-type lookup,
generic-impl methods on enum receivers, the `return(<owned RC local>)`
double-drop fix, the anonymous-fn no-expected-type throw, and the ComptimeIndex
custom-type dispatch port. Score **150 GREEN / 23 HOLLOW / 10 RED**.

### `tests/index.test.yo` has THREE independent roots, not one

This file is the clearest case of "error shape != root cause" in the whole
campaign. Each fix removed exactly one layer and revealed the next:

1. **`call to undeclared function 'yo_id_NNNN'`** (RED) — the shallow-vs-deep
   `type_contains_some_type` on the `___dispose` path. FIXED (`e798f7ff4`);
   the file went RED -> HOLLOW, _not_ GREEN, while the four sibling files with
   the identical clang error did flip.
2. **`comptime_expect_error` saw no error** — `ComptimeIndex` custom-type
   dispatch was an explicit unported stub, so `p(usize(2))` fell through to the
   RUNTIME `Index` impl whose out-of-bounds arm is a runtime panic rather than a
   compile error. FIXED (`2b70886da`), verified on an isolated repro (markers
   1 -> 0). The file stayed HOLLOW.
3. **STILL OPEN — `ComptimeList` indexing with a `comptime_int` literal.**
   Batch test #29:

   ```rust
   l :: ComptimeList(i32)(10, 20, 30);
   comptime_assert(l(0) == 10, "l(0) should be 10");
   l(0) = 99;
   ```

   Swallowed error (`__DBG_F`, the fatal one):
   `Type does not implement Index for the given argument type.`
   accompanied by 8x `__DBG_W Cannot unify incompatible types: "comptime_int"
and "usize"`. That pairing is the lead: `ComptimeList(T)`'s impl is
   **generic** — `impl(generic(T : Type), where(T <: Comptime), ComptimeList(T),
ComptimeIndex(usize)(...))` (std/prelude.yo:5819-5829) — and the argument `0`
   is `comptime_int`, so the `ComptimeIndex(usize)` trait-argument match appears
   to be strict where it must widen. TS accepts it: `are_types_compatible`
   widens `comptime_int` -> `usize` (`findComptimeIndexMethod`,
   index-trait.ts:404-408).

   Minimal differential (`/tmp/clist.yo`, 8 lines — the three statements above
   in a `main`): TS emits **0** `Failed to transpile`, s1 emits **2**. Use this
   rather than the whole test file.

   **RESOLVED (see below). Root: argument order.** The two obvious hypotheses
   were both wrong; keeping them recorded because each cost a probe:

   - `are_types_compatible(usize, comptime_int)` is **not** the problem. The
     ComptimeInt widening arm (`types/compatibility.yo:124-146`) explicitly
     lists `.Usize => true`, so the parameter check in `_find_index_method`
     passes. (It is gated on `require_exact` being false — worth confirming the
     index path does not set it, but the arm exists.)
   - The `Cannot unify incompatible types` throw site is a **faithful port**.
     yo-self's synthesizer fallback (`evaluator/types/synthesizer.yo:1979-1994`)
     compares raw type TAGS and throws; TS's `synthesizeTypes`
     (`src/evaluator/types/synthesizer.ts:1076-1088`) does _exactly_ the same.
     So the bug is NOT in the comparison.

   Therefore the divergence is **upstream**: TS never reaches that fallback with
   `(usize, comptime_int)`, and yo-self does. The next probe should find out WHY
   — either TS's caller widens/coerces the argument type before synthesizing the
   trait argument, or an earlier `synthesizeTypes` case intercepts the pair. Walk
   the generic-impl match path (`get_receiver_methods_by_name_from_env` ->
   the `find_methods_from_generic_impls` callback -> `try_match_generic_impl`)
   and compare against TS's equivalent, rather than touching either of the two
   sites above.

#### Root of #3 FOUND: `are_types_compatible` argument order

`_find_index_method` and `_find_comptime_index_method`
(yo-self/evaluator/calls/index_trait.yo:304, :840) called

    are_types_compatible(p1, arg_type)      // p1 = the PARAMETER's declared type

but yo-self's signature is `are_types_compatible(actual, expected)`
(types/compatibility.yo:934) — so the _parameter_ type was passed as the
"actual". Every comptime widening arm keys off `actual`
(`is_comptime_int_type(actual)` at :124, `is_comptime_string_type(actual)` at
:171), so with `actual = usize` none of them fired and the check fell through to
the tag comparison: `usize != comptime_int` -> reject -> "Type does not implement
Index for the given argument type".

TS spells the same check `areTypesCompatible({type: idxParam.type}, {type: argType})`
(index-trait.ts:404-406) — but **TS's first position is `expected` and its second
is `given`**, the opposite of yo-self's. So the faithful port must SWAP the
arguments, not copy the order. Fixed to `are_types_compatible(arg_type, p1)`.

The discriminator that found it, in three cheap compiles (no probe build needed):

| probe                                                                                                | result    | conclusion                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `l.len()` / `l.get(usize(0))` — same generic impl, same `where(T <: Comptime)`, NOT Index-dispatched | 0 markers | the impl and where-clause are fine |
| `l(usize(0))` — Index dispatch, argument already `usize`                                             | 0 markers | the Index path itself is fine      |
| `l(0)` — Index dispatch, argument `comptime_int`                                                     | 2 markers | **only the argument TYPE matters** |

Effect on `tests/index.test.yo`: **hollow=1 markers=1 -> hollow=0 markers=0**.
The evaluator side of that file is now complete for the first time. It is still
RED, on a FOURTH root:

4. **STILL OPEN — comptime index-assignment emits the folded value as an lvalue.**
   5 clang errors, all of the shape `0 = 42;`, `10 = 99;`, `1 = 100;` — codegen
   emitted the LHS's folded comptime VALUE on the left of an assignment. These
   come from `l(0) = 99` on a `ComptimeList`, which must be a COMPILE-TIME-ONLY
   assignment emitting no C at all.

   The machinery exists and is not the problem: assignment.yo's Step 6
   (`lhs_info.comptime_ref`, :680-708) mutates the shared list in place and sets
   `is_comptime_only_prop = true`, mirroring assignment.ts:1175-1194. The gap is
   that `comptime_ref` is never POPULATED for a ComptimeList index result — TS's
   `tryComptimeCustomTypeIndex` PtrVal-deref block builds a ComptimeRef only for
   the array / struct / tuple target shapes (index-trait.ts:551-579), yet
   assignment.ts:1183 has a `case "comptime_list"`, so something upstream must
   build a `ComptimeListRef`. Find what produces it in TS (start at
   `__yo_comptime_list_index` in src/evaluator/builtins/comptime-index-fns.ts:188)
   and mirror it — do NOT add a case to the deref block on the assumption it
   belongs there.

### Other still-open items re-confirmed

- `tests/algebraic_effects.test.yo` — now **hollow=0** (71 tests genuinely pass)
  with ONE real failure, "Test zero-arg unwind exits unit function". Its
  remaining FTT'd arms are `ctl` handler assignments
  (`(raise : Raise) = (() -> { unwind(); })`), which are a SEPARATE pre-existing
  gap: verified by running the pre-change and post-change s1 on that shape
  standalone — identical 1 marker, while TS compiles and runs it. The
  ctl-handler assignment path does not set `ctx.expected_type`.
- `tests/prelude.test.yo` — a design exists but is deliberately NOT applied: its
  own author found a second independent blocker (`try_into` fails with a SINGLE
  impl and no overloading involved), so the patch would touch a hot dispatch
  path without flipping the file.

## Reproducing this measurement

```bash
# 1. diagnostic build (~4 min): copy yo-self, add the three probes, compile
cp -R yo-self /tmp/ydiag2   # then add eprintln at the three sites above
./yo-cli compile /tmp/ydiag2/main.yo --release -o /tmp/s1_swal

# 2. sweep the hollow files, then a GREEN baseline to subtract
BIN=/tmp/s1_swal OUT=/tmp/swal     LIST=/tmp/hollow.txt    scratchpad/swallow_sweep.sh
BIN=/tmp/s1_swal OUT=/tmp/swalbase LIST=/tmp/greenbase.txt scratchpad/swallow_sweep.sh
```

Both sweeps write batch artifacts into each test file's own directory, so they must run
**serially** — never two `test` invocations against one directory.
